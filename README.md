# Love's End Recovery
A playable version of "Love's End", a song from Funk Mix that was never used due to its cancellation. With help from SAKKth, this mod includes everything that was originally supposed to be in the official update!

This song is based off of an old video called "Mario From Hell", which you can watch here: https://youtu.be/KpNKVtny1pQ

Other features of this mod:
- A fully recreated Funk Mix powerup and health system in Psych Engine, as well as the Funk Mix UI
- The original chart for the song by Snak (as well as my own chart that was used before receiving Snak's!)
- A few easter eggs ;)
- Mid song events! (There's only, like, 2 (but they're really cool trust me))
